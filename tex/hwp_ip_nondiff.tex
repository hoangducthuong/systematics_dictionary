\subsection{HWP $I\rightarrow P$}
\label{IP downstream of HWP}
\paragraph{Description:}
When passing through the HWP, incoming polarized radiation is rotated by $2\chi$, where $\chi$ is the rotation angle of the HWP optical axis. The signal is finally seen by the detectors at $4\chi$. Any unpolarized signal which is modulated at $4\chi$ represents a source of systematics. A list of possible sources of spurious $4\chi$ signals can be found in Sec.III of~\cite{ABS}.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Plan to model/measure effect. Use SRFs to describe how well we understand/can model the effect. Is there a good null test that we could use to catch this effect?

\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
This section should include the uncertainty of
known parameters and/or the expected range of parameters for consideration

\paragraph{Parameterization:}
This section should include the parameterization of figures of
merit and the output to the SWGs.

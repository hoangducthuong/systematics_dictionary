\subsection{Differential Gain}

\paragraph{Description:}
Miscalibrations of relative bolometer gains in a pixel pair can leak temperature signal into $Q$ and $U$. This effect is particularly enhanced if we use pair-differencing to gain polarization sensitivity. This effect is less pronounced when polarization modulators are used.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Leakage from gain mismatch can be computed using the formalism described in \cite{rosset2010}.

Simulations for various scanning strategies should be performed. These simulations will be useful not only to estimate the precision we need for the gain but also for the polarization efficiencies and detector orientations.


\textbf{Inlcude more details on how to model/measure/mitigate. SRF}

\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}

\textbf{Do we know how big this effect is?}

\paragraph{Parameterization:}
\textbf{How do we parameterize this for SWGS?}

\subsection{Differential Gain}

\paragraph{Description:}
Miscalibrations of relative bolometer gains in a pixel pair will ``leak'' temperature signal into $Q$ and $U$.
This effect is particularly enhanced if we subtract two bolometers within pairs to obtain the polarized part of the timestream. If we just deconvolved timestreams (using rotating HWP), we might not really care about this?

I am not sure to understand the last comment.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Leakage from gain mismatch can be computed using the formalism described in \cite{rosset2010}. Simulations for various scanning strategies should be performed. These simulations will be useful not only to estimate the precision we need for the gain but also for the polarization efficiencies and detector orientations.

\subsection{Differential Optical Properties of a HWP}
\label{HWP Differential Optical Properties}

\paragraph{Description:}
The birefringence of the HWP causes different transmission efficiencies along the fast and slow axes of the crystal,
producing different absorption and emission coeficcients along the two axes.
Because of this, transmitted unpolarized light and emitted light both leave the HWP partially polarized.
The polarization direction rotates with the HWP, and so this signal couples to the detector at 2f.


\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
In order to model this effect we require the HWP mueller matrix, and information about the optical chain.

Using the temperatures, efficiencies, and emissivities of each element in the optical chain,
the unpolarized power can be propagated through each element to find the incident unpolarized power on the HWP.
If $P_n$ is the unpolarized power on the $n^\text{th}$ element, $\eta_n$ the efficiency, $\varepsilon_n$ the emissivity, and $B$ the spectral brightness
the propagation step is 
\begin{equation}
\label{unpolarized_propagation}
P_{n+1}(\nu) = \eta_n(\nu) P_n(\nu) + \varepsilon_n(\nu) A\Omega(\nu)\;  B(\nu, T_n) .
\end{equation}


The HWP Mueller matrix is calculated using the method described in \cite{Salatino16}, and is of the form
\[
M_\text{HWP} = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
T & \rho & 0 & 0\\
\rho & T & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & c & -s \\
0 & 0 & s & c
\end{array}
\right),
\]
where all elements are dependent on frequency and incident angle.
$\rho$ is the polarized absorption and emissivity of the HWP.
Though the polarized fraction of the transmitted and emitted light are the same but with opposite signs,
they do not cancel since the radiation sources are at different temperatures.
If we define $P_\text{HWP}$ to be the incident power on the HWP, the polarized power output is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:polarized_output}
P_\text{HWP + 1}(\nu) = \rho(\nu)(P_\text{HWP} - A\Omega(\nu)B(\nu, T_\text{HWP})),
\end{equation}
with $a_2 = \rho$. 

If we define $\eta_\text{det}$ to be the combined efficiency of all elements after the HWP,
the final 2f signal produced by the HWP is 
\[
A^{(2)} = \int_{\nu_\text{low}}^{\nu_\text{high}} \eta(\nu) P_\text{HWP + 1}(\nu) d\nu.
\]
\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
For 145 GHz, this method gives values of $a_2 = .35\%$, and a value of 
$A^{(2)} = .0165 \text{ pW} = 238 \text{ mK}_\text{CMB}$

\paragraph{Parameterization:}
We require $T$ and $\rho$ from the HWP Mueller matrix\cite{Salatino16}, and an optical chain input file containing
absorption, temperature, and spill/scatter/reflect coefficients for each element.

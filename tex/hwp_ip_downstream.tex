\subsection{$I\rightarrow P$ leakage and Instrumental Polarization downstream of the HWP}
\label{IP downstream of HWP}
\paragraph{Description:}
%Description of systematic effect, including relevant equations andparameterization for TWGs. Note that each variable in each equation should bedefined. This should include where we expect to get the value of this variable from (TWG, literature, etc.)
Say something about how the I to P of elements downstream of the HWP are not modulated so this I to P is mitigated by the HWP. However, some polarized reflections off of these elements can reflect off of the HWP and cause I to P leakage.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
%Plan to model/measure effect. Use SRFs to describe how well we understand/can model the effect. Is there a good null test that we could use to catch this effect?

\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
%This section should include the uncertainty of known parameters and/or the expected range of parameters for consideration

\paragraph{Parameterization:}
%This section should include the parameterization of figures of merit and the output to the SWGs.

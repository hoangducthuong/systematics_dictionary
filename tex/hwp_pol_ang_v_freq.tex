\subsection{Polarization Angle Frequency Dependence of HWP}

\paragraph{Description:}
%Description of systematic effect, including relevant equations and
%parameterization for TWGs. Note that each variable in each equation should be
%defined. This should include where we expect to get the value of this variable
%from (TWG, literature, etc.)

We define polarization angle as the angle betweeen the light and the HWP, with incident light being rotated by the HWP to a different, transmitted angle. This polarization angle has a dependence on the frequency of light, as well as the optical properties.

A strategy to mitigate this systematics has been proposed in \cite{Matsumura14}. It consists of an additional, stationary HWP behind the rotating one. This counteracts the frequency polarization angle dependence while maintaining broadband polarization modulation. 

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
%Plan to model/measure effect. Use TRLs to describe how well we understand/can model the effect.
A Muller Matrix paramaterization should be sufficient to model this effect, although it also could be modeled using a full transmission line model.  The transmission line model may more accuratly capture the behavior since it takes the multiple reflections between the various layers into account.

For a silicon metamaterial HWP, the phase shifter and its AR can be modeled in HFSS; this depenendence can be easily derived from the simulation.

Several HWP are available inside the Simons Observatory collaboration that can be used in laboratory to measure this effect, such as by using a vector network analyzer set up.

\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
%This section should include the uncertainty of
%known parameters and/or the expected range of parameters for consideration
Discussion in \cite{Matsumura09} show this can be up to about 20 degrees for some HWPs.




\paragraph{Parameterization:}
%This section should include the parameterization of figures of
%merit and the output to the SWGs.

As discussed in \cite{Matsumura09}, a Muller Matrix representation of the HWP stack can give the frequency dependence of the polarization angle effectively.
